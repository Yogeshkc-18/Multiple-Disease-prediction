# Multiple-Disease-prediction


ðŸ©º Multi-Disease Prediction System
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The Multi-Disease Prediction System is a web application built using Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of three different diseases:

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

Indian Liver Patient Disease (ILPD)

Parkinsonâ€™s Disease

The app uses pre-trained machine learning models for each disease and allows users to select the disease they want to check from a sidebar Option Menu.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Predicts Kidney Disease based on medical test results like Age, Blood Pressure, Sugar Levels, Creatinine, Hemoglobin, etc.
âœ… Predicts Indian Liver Disease using Age, Gender, Albumin, Bilirubin, and enzyme levels.
âœ… Predicts Parkinsonâ€™s Disease using voice measurement parameters.
âœ… User-friendly Streamlit dashboard with a clean design.
âœ… Single application for all three diseases using Option Menu navigation.
âœ… Instant predictions with pre-trained models.
